                        <p>
                            Corruption of data may result from many factors, especially without the protection of the atmosphere.
                            This can result in inaccurate transfer of information.

                        <p>
                            The first step to data integrity (or how we are going to transfer data) is being aware of environmental 
                            issues BEFORE transferring files. In outer space, the transfer of data can become corrupted by 
                            astronomical objects that have a changing magnetic field, such as the planets and our Sun.

                            Data pictured below show emissions from a variety of sources including radio bursts from the Sun, the 
                            Earth, and even from Jupiter's ionosphere whose wavelengths measure about fifteen meters in length. The 
                            far right of this graph shows radio bursts from the Sun caused by electrons that have been ejected into 
                            space during solar flares moving at 20% of the speed of light.

                            ​Transferring data is oftentimes ill-advised in the presence of extreme radio waves such as these, 
                            and resulting files are often riddled with “noise,” or data that’s corrupted, distorted, or otherwise meaningless.

                        <p>
                            A cosmic-ray observatory is a scientific installation built to detect high-energy-particles coming from space 
                            called cosmic rays. This typically includes photons (high-energy light), electrons, protons, and some heavier 
                            nuclei, as well as antimatter particles. About 90% of cosmic rays are protons, 9% are alpha particles, and the 
                            remaining ~1% are other particles. For our purposes, it will be able to detect the disrupting radio waves. When 
                            we detect a spike in the waves, it is unsafe to transfer data (we will not), and vice versa (no waves = safe transfer).

                        <p>
                            Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) uses principles of quantum mechanics to enable two parties to establish a shared 
                            secret key for secure communication, which can then be used to verify file integrity through transfers. The key 
                            aspects of QKD are typically based on the principles of quantum superposition and quantum entanglement.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Quantum Superposition: In quantum mechanics, particles such as photons can exist in multiple states simultaneously, 
                            a phenomenon known as superposition. QKD often uses a quantum property called polarization. Photons can be polarized 
                            in different directions, representing the 0s and 1s of a binary code.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Quantum Entanglement: Entanglement is a quantum phenomenon where two or more particles become correlated in such a way 
                            that the state of one particle is directly related to the state of another, regardless of the distance between them. 
                            QKD systems leverage entangled particles to create a shared secret key.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The process for using these quantum principles to verify file integrity through transfers is as such:
                        </p>
                        <ol style="text-indent: 0;">
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    QKD typically involves the exchange of quantum particles (usually photons) between the two communicating parties, 
                                    often referred to as Alice and Bob. Alice sends a stream of entangled photons to Bob. Each photon represents a bit 
                                    in the key. Due to the principles of quantum mechanics, any attempt to eavesdrop on the communication (by intercepting 
                                    and measuring the photons) would disturb their quantum states, and this disturbance can be detected.
                                </p>
                            </li>

                                <p>
                                    After receiving the entangled photons, Bob measures their polarization states using a chosen basis. Alice and Bob publicly 
                                    announce the basis they used for each bit without revealing the actual measurement results.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Alice and Bob compare a subset of their bits where the measurement basis matches. Any discrepancy between their measurements 
                                    indicates potential eavesdropping or errors in the key generation process.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            Pairing with a future key based post-quantum encryption scheme should create a resilient network for years to come. Note QKD is in 
                            its infancy, but research right now is pushing the bounds of what is possible.

                            Ensuring data integrity during the transmission of files in space is paramount due to the harsh and unpredictable conditions of 
                            the space environment. Space missions rely heavily on the transmission of data between spacecraft, ground stations, and other 
                            devices. Any corruption or loss of data during transmission can have serious consequences, jeopardizing the success of the mission 
                            or compromising critical information. To mitigate these risks, advanced error detection and correction techniques are employed. These 
                            techniques include checksums, redundancy, and error-correcting codes, which allow for the detection and, in some cases, correction of 
                            errors that may occur during data transmission. Additionally, protocols such as the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) 
                            provide standards and guidelines specifically tailored for space data communications, ensuring interoperability and reliability across 
                            different space missions and agencies.

                            Moreover, space agencies employ sophisticated communication systems and protocols designed to cope with the challenges of space 
                            communication, such as signal degradation, cosmic radiation, and long distances. For instance, deep space missions often utilize 
                            powerful antennas and modulation techniques to maintain communication over vast distances. Furthermore, protocols like the 
                            Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocol are specifically designed for space communications, allowing for efficient data transmission 
                            even in scenarios where traditional networking protocols fail, such as when there are long delays or disruptions in connectivity. 
                            Overall, ensuring data integrity in transferring files in space requires a combination of robust error detection and correction techniques, s
                            pecialized communication protocols, and advanced hardware and software systems tailored to the unique challenges of the space environment.

                        <p>
                            The threat of hackers sabotaging space satellites and potential moon bases is a concerning possibility as humanity 
                            ventures further into space exploration. Space infrastructure, including satellites and future moon bases, are critical 
                            for telecommunications, navigation, Earth observation, and potentially sustaining human life beyond Earth. A successful 
                            cyberattack on these assets could have catastrophic consequences, disrupting communication networks, compromising data 
                            integrity, and even endangering lives. Hackers could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in the software, communication 
                            protocols, or control systems of these space assets to gain unauthorized access, manipulate operations, or cause physical 
                            damage. Such attacks could be motivated by various factors, including espionage, terrorism, or geopolitical tensions, 
                            highlighting the importance of robust cybersecurity measures in space systems.

                            Furthermore, the emergence of quantum computers poses a new and unprecedented challenge to space cybersecurity. 
                            Quantum computers have the potential to break many of the cryptographic algorithms currently used to secure data 
                            transmission and communication networks, rendering traditional encryption methods obsolete. This could significantly 
                            amplify the threat posed by hackers, allowing them to decrypt sensitive information, intercept communication channels, 
                            and compromise the integrity of space missions with greater ease. As quantum computing technology advances, space agencies 
                            and satellite operators must proactively develop quantum-resistant encryption algorithms and protocols to safeguard space 
                            assets against this emerging threat. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These are just the most apparent threats faced by a space program. There is always human error 
                            that will leave you unprotected. This may include laps in security practices that come with comfort and patterns.
