# One time Pad encryption implementaion
This is the method of reading and encrypting the text


### 1. Git Cloning a Repo:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of the repository you want to clone.

### 2. Make a New Branch:

```bash
git checkout -b <new_branch_name>
```

This command creates a new branch (`<new_branch_name>`) and switches to it.

### 3. Pushing Changes to Your Branch:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin <your_branch_name>
```


Replace `<your_branch_name>` with the name of your branch. The sequence of commands adds changes, commits them with a message, and then pushes the changes to the remote repository.

### 4. Go to github and make a pr(Pull Request)


### 5.Close branch on your machine
```bash
git branch -d <branch_name>
```
